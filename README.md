<br>
I am JP.<br>
I am currently working in building my Github profile and portfolio. I am also a DJ and I love music.<br>
Although, I have held different positions on my career, I have never quit developing software and learning about technology. 
I use Linux as my desktop operating system and I have build my own development and testing lab at home with a docker/kubernetes server and containers. 
I also have some projects on micro electronics for IoT and automation development. 
I can code in C, C++ C#, python, javasricpt, java and other languajes as well. I have been also working on Devops and Infrasestructure as code development.
Always open to help, collaboration and innovative projects.
(FullStack)
